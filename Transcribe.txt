Doctor, ive been having these terrible headaches and flu symptoms lately. Its been really affecting my daily life. Im sorry to hear that. Lets see what we can do to help. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Its been about a week now. Ive been feeling really fatigued with a stuffy nose and sore throat as well. Okay, it sounds like you might have a viral infection. Before we proceed, we received your recent blood test results and your hemoglobin level is quite low at ten. I would like to run some further tests to understand the underlying cause. It could be contributing to your fatigue and headaches. Oh I wasnt aware of that. What kind of tests do you suggest? Well need to perform a comprehensive blood workup to assess your iron levels as well as a few other tests to rule out any other potential causes for the low hemoglobin. Ill also prescribe you some iron supplements to help boost your levels in the meantime. Alright I understand. Thank you for letting me know. Of course its important to address this issue to ensure your overall health. Once we have the results, we can tailor a treatment plan to address both your infection and low hemoglobin levels effectively. Thank you doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness and care. Youre welcome. Ill prescribe euphofolvit, an iron supplement. Take it every morning for the next 20 days. After that well schedule another appointment for further tests to monitor your progress. Its important to follow this regimen closely to help boost your hemoglobin levels effectively and well have you feeling better soon.
